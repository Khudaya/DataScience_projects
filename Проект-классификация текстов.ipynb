In addition , the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed `` '' not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials '' '' . '' '' Regarding : In addition , the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed `` '' not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials '' '' That statement appears to come from Ref [ 3 ] on page 10 . The full quote is '' '' If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload , then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials , although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures . '' '' It then goes on to say '' '' As we shall see , presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL tethers needed . The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is : “ We do n't need magic materials like ‘ Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes ’ to make the space tether facility for a HASTOL system . Existing materials will do. ” '' '' So it would appear that you misread your reference . The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem . Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with `` '' presently available commercial materials . '' '' To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states '' '' The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is technically feasible . We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting , spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into Earth orbit . For more than one HASTOL architecture concept , we have developed a design solution using existing , or near-term technologies .

       " 81: \"`` Is it scientific to attribute an event A , to cause B , where cause B was deliberate designed , with some sort of intelligent intent ? Do n't answer the questions beyond that Well , the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged . There are several major fundamental problems here . First , you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth . Natural science might look at a honeycomb , see it is built by bees , and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb , and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees . That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth . ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here . This is not science in any sense of the word , it is mythology . When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox , they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes . No evidence of paul and his ox remain . i mean , really . Second , natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable . Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up . ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with `` '' probabilities '' '' . If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally , how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria ? If you do n't understand it , you ca n't do statistics on it . ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that does n't have a complete , detailed , natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say `` '' well , it 's so improbable for this to happen , that someone MUST have designed it '' '' . This is such a perversion of science . You can assign probabilities to something you do n't understand . ID is just making up their numbers . Finally , your example has A- > B , where B was deliberate design . that 's all well and good for a rigged example , except that with respect to life on earth , `` '' B '' '' is unknown . Your A- > B example might qualify as forensic science , if `` '' A '' '' were a dead body and `` '' B '' '' were a bullet in the heart . You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart , the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart , you can probably figure that 's what killed him . You do n't have that with life on earth . You have ONE scenario , `` '' A '' '' , and you have no other cases to observe or test . So , in that sense , A- > B is not scientific if you 've never actually observed `` '' B '' '' . ( btw , B is teh intelligent designer , which has NEVER been observed ) . So , in that sense , no , it is n't science. ``\",\n",

       " 114: 'Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized . However , the term fossilized is not a very precise term . There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil . One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate , invertebrates , radiolarians , sponges , plants , pollen , foot prints , etc . And multiple processes may include permineralization , recrystalization , carbonization , replacement , dissolving , diagenesis , etc . Talking about fossilization is a complex issue , however quick burial is not questioned . The major question is , how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in ? Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab , which of course implies that given the right conditions , vast ages are not an issue . The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains . Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood , but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working . Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains . Yet , how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with .',\n",

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters , and the honour of the Witzeman . For those who have ever been a Witzeman , it has been said to have been a great honour , although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed . A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years , until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams . Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman . The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods , who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek ' . He has not told a great number of people his testimony , but has promised to do so in years to come . History The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years , because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour , to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time . The term 'Witzeman ' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man ' , witze being an 11th century term for ' a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence ' . Unfortuneatly , Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind , for unspeakable reasons . Proper History As early as the 14th century , Witzemen were considered outcasts , and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks . This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team . This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman , as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga ' at a Government meeting that year . The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history . However good times were to come for the Witzeman . Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s , building up to a great moment in the history ... the Great Rebellion of 1988 . This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons , wearing clown masks , but otherwise completely naked . This was thought to be an act of circambulation . However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour , were 'mentally , spiritually , and emotionallly scarred for life ' . This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability , suffering from trauma . It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman . In 1990 , a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed , stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased . Although this was a formal agreement , many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman , as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted .\",\n",

       " 160: \"`` == Attributing and classifying of personalities == Invitation . Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed . Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here . I propose a quite liberal variant of it , where definition may not be connected with one certain word . Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains . My initial ideas on this branch , the ones , concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period : Some artists , writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists . This definition is not false , but some more concrete things should be added , some specifics of Lithuania . We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat . Renaissance from later modernism , which is more known for us . Cultural aspirations of the later Nat . Ren . may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania . But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage , and their expression may be seen as something simply typically Lithuanian . I mean , that such authors in as Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context , but it also ( and even more ) is a representative of Lithuanian culture , when in European or World-wide context . A parallel example may be taken from literature of India . Poet Tagore , well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India . Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture . But in his own country , he was seen as a modernist too , who was changing traditional cultural forms , especially stagnated ones . This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren . could be seen as modernists , which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones , in Lithuanian context . They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context , but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture . Čiurlionis is the best example here . In other way , the later Lithuanian modernists ( they depended mostly to later generation , approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century ) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose ( looking generally ) was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life ( see the table below ) . We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here . The problem is , that both movements collaborated , especially their political wings did , and interchange of ideas between them is well seen . So , many researchers do n't pay attention to this difference . Especially in the Soviet period , when national ideas were officially forbidden , mixture in description of these movements was allowed . E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas , who clearly depends to the first generation , is often described as liberal . And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation ( as idea of liberalism ) . period and generation artists , writers , philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period , the younger generation , approx 1905 – 1930 painter and composer Čiurlionis , painter Kazys Šimonis , poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas , dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė , poets Adomas Jakštas , Motiejus Gustaitis , Liudas Gira , composer Stasys Šimkus , philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas . reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture , almost unknown before them .

The major changes are that each month , right after the Council meeting , this will be sent out and will include two featured programs and a sum up of the meeting .

I do not want that happenning . Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided ? . Thank you . Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 At last we agree on something ! ... of course that the new section is a good idea : The false `` '' suicidal '' '' terrorists from PRISA will also be included there . Come oooooon , boys , start writing that section . I do not want all the kudos for myself : The new proposed article is , by now , an effort made only by me . But remember : NPOV and sources , all the sources . Just like me citing `` '' El País '' '' in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb . Cheers Indeed , a good point . And all the remarks in COPE too . And the `` '' moral certitudes '' '' of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo . I agree with you 100 % , Larean . What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so , the original version he created was entirely POV , as is much of the rest of the proposed article . Also , all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not . You are right , Southofwatford , in your `` '' Randroide omits ... '' '' section . If you have not subscription to `` '' El País '' '' , I am sorry but that´s your problem . My `` '' institutional '' '' access also has some advantages , like paid access to `` '' El País '' '' ( and many , many other publications and books ) . That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of `` '' filtered '' '' Internet accesss : It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources . Do you see ? . The truncation of words is offsett ( I think ) by better sources . BTW , if you write under a `` '' Randroide answers '' '' section you are : Invading `` '' my '' '' space . I do not mind , really . But you are doing it . Risking new truncations on your messages . To avoid this , please write OUTSIDE `` '' Randroide answers '' '' sections . If you think that the proposed article is POV , work in it to make it NPOV . The article is not `` '' mine '' '' . I 'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here , it 's very short . The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País , its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it . All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article , putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is , to my mind , completely unreasonable . All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article Very funny , Southofwatford . I am going to follow this joke of yours .

Delete all the references in spanish , because , did you know ? , there are users who know no spanish . It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes , really . I had a good laugh . User : Southofwatford How strange that you should find it so funny , after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced , so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny , it 's simply bizarre .

       " 321: \"`` 66.185.85.80 's rant Presently , we are witnessing an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture . Croatian Left often portrays this culture as `` '' primitive '' '' and `` '' rural '' '' ( even `` '' fashist '' '' ) being in service of Conservative HDZ party . Croatian writer Predrag Raos , for instance , `` '' performed '' '' on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year ( 2004 ) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition . Another `` '' apostle '' '' of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as `` '' gusle players '' '' . Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda ( all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian ) . However , Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian . Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture . For example , the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music , Marko Kraljević , is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović 's book `` '' Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje '' '' , 1568 ) . Also , the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in Dubrovnik ( 1547 ) . Even now , a contemporary Croatian writer ( born in Dubrovnik ) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle ( also from Dubrovnik area ) who could memorize numerous gusle songs ( Stijepo Mijović Kočan : Gusle , Glasnik , May 25 , 1992 , p. 42 ) . Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin ( born Kalafatović , 1816 ) , a daughter of famous gusle player Ante . Although illiterate , she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs , some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry . Not far from Dubrovnik , another coastal city - Makarska – was also a bastion of Croatian gusle music . Actually , this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players . This Mediterranean area also gave birth to Andrija Kačić Miošić ( 18th century Catholic priest ) , who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond . To honour Kačić 's work , Ivan Meštrović , the most famous Croatian sculptor , built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument . In addition to Kačić , Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music . According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić ( who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović ) , Zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić ( 1771-1818 ) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš ( 1844-1915 ) . As for Dalmatian women , they did n't play gusle ( it 's considered a male activity only ) , yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound . Olinko Delorko , the researcher of Dalmatian folk poetry in the 1960s , states in his book Ljuba Ivanova ( 1969 ) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women , especially the ones from the island of Hvar . The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition . English writer Maude M. Holbach , travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century states in her book `` '' Dalmatia : The Land Where East Meets West '' '' that the gusle was the national instrument of the region . As for Dinaric dances , which took place at markets and certain festivals , they are very picturesque and interesting , and worth going a long way to see , being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe ( p.54 ) This admiration for Dinaric folk music , particularly gusle , was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and Hinterland . Matija Murko , the researcher of this literary/music forms , had reported that during his trips through Dalmatia in the 1930s , he saw a child , barely three years old playing gusle ( Eduard Osredečki : “ Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme ” , Željezno-Beč , p. 9 ) Now , lets take a look at the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations : Hajduk , Junak , Gusar , Alkar , Uskok , sinjska alka , etc . What do they have in common ? Of course , their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region . Having this in mind , one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost extinct . Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock ' n ' roll culture ? If so , why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its Dinaric counterpart ( gusle music ) is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre\",\n",

'' '' He sees no alternative to a dissolution ; it has always been expected , some wished for it before now , though he is opposed to hastening the Government 's fall . ... ' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin 's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement , achieved at a conference in London , on the Dawes Plan for reparations , and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party 's subservience to its extremists , and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement . But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion . Two days before , in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet , the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence , preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes , p. 273. ``\",\n",

This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong ( Wikipedia has no theology of its own ) , but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view . Of course , this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties , since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers , US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes .

You are invited to comment on the discussion at Wikipedia : Templates for deletion # Template : SilentRedirect .

I am allowed to watermark images with anything whatsoever I wish to , even if it 's a contradiction , and if you wish me to use up further WP bandwidth by re-uploading them , that has no effect on me . I ca n't do anything until this evening , and if any get deleted , I shall reupload them . Yours without respect ( talk|email ) You could have the grace to reply . I said that I 'd deal with them this evening , but only the ones where the watermark is visible from the page .

I am certainly on the verge of requesting mediation , as you are disrupting my life , never mind WP , to make a point . I will tell you one more time : any images are better than none . If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images , you 're damn welcome to try , but they are GFDL therefore there 's no grounds for removal . ( talk|email ) PS - I shall add the external link again , not as an image , and if you remove it I shall make a formal complaint to the Wikimedia Foundation , and the Information Commissioner in London . ( talk|email ) , your conduct is a little off in this matter . While I 'm all for discussing the issues with users , let 's keep it civil please ? Thanks . ( talk ) I disagree , Rob - it is far more than `` '' a little '' '' off . Images watermarked as such are not in any way appropriate for Wikipedia . This is an encyclopædia , not a pet image project . If `` '' TheDoctor10 '' '' is n't happy to play ball , he can go elsewhere . ( talk ) I am proposing a change to the image use policy to forbid watermarked images . Please voice an opinion at Wikipedia_talk : Image_use_policy # User-created_images -Thanks - talk I edit from the United Kingdom , and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act , the editing of information online is illegal , without permission . The button at the top of every page that says `` '' Edit this page '' '' , among other things , constitutes that permission , while the policies and guidelines form conditions . Since there is no condition against my image , it has a legal right to be there . Q.E.D . ( talk|email ) True , but therefore your addition fails under the same logic . Also , Wikimedia own the servers , it 's their right to delete it . 13ID:540053 Apologies to Ed for invading his talk page , but what a load of rubbish ! Wikipedia are under no legal obligation whatsoever to host your images , regardless of whether they meet any policy . I have no idea under what flawed logic you presume that the fact you can edit Wikipedia means that your edits must legally be accepted . If the Computer Misuse Act states that the editing of information online is illegal without permission , that implies that editing with permission is legal , and nothing more . Furthermore , by your logic , I have the legal right to edit Wikipedia , and remove your images ... I fail to see what on earth you intend to tell your lawyer , but I do n't imagine the Wikimedia board are too concerned ... └ '' ' '' '/talk┐ Ignoring the gibberish i\",\n",

       " 550: \"`` : : : : : : : : : : Tim , firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline , and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour . Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in , there is clearly a massive diffence between , say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions , or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions , since the legal and regulatory systems are very different , as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets . Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in , say , Paris or Toulouse , even though they are both in the same jurisdiction . I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions . Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though . To give an example , the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market , but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist , niche and focused on high tech . To give another example , in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it did n't have an office in London , even if it had offices in every other big city . In fact all of the very top tier UK firms ( DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them , despite its size ) have just one UK office , in London , although they have other offices overseas . Saying that DLA has `` '' has 69 offices across the United States , Egypt , South Africa , Kenya , Thailand , China , ... '' '' would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader . We could fall back on using descriptions like `` '' in major financial centres '' '' or `` '' in major commercial centres '' '' or `` '' in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres '' '' but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness , imprecision and even original research . I do accept that DLA , with 69 offices , is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article . However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it , and should be included as much as possible.

I 'll tell you why : the user was n't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles . He/she was involved in blocking input to the article . Why ? Was it personal against me , or was it to preserve the existing content of the article , including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand ?

His/her behavior is malicious , but probably not malware , just the normal human collection of problems .

Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge . `` `` He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception , '' '' Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870 . `` `` He believed in common schools , and not in political science ; in ledgers and cash-books , but not in Adam Smith or Mill ; as one might believe in the multiplication-table , but not in Laplace or Newton . By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice , and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions . `` `` Henry Adams , `` '' The Session , '' '' North American Review , July , 1870 , p. 36 . But in a very corrupt time , it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post , either for himself or his friends . Living within his salary , he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure . His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker though never for money .

French Papers , Library of Congress . `` `` Boutwell 's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic . `` `` Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments ; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part , , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington , remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses .

In response to your question , let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation : The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view . ( I have n't yet worked in `` '' no original research '' '' . ) WP : NOR says that we must n't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions . Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research . We can integrate information , so long as we do n't arrive at new theories . Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy . The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate . Getting down to details , the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source . The Bauer site , even if somewhat unreliable , may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer . I 'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct . However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable . The sources are sufficient , and no original conclusions are made . The website takedown issue is confusing to me , but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources . Overall , my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better . Attack articles are not encouraged . While we must show our subjects `` '' warts and all '' '' we should n't enlarge the warts , nor ignore their better features . Balance is a part of NPOV . - '' '' but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources . '' '' There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war . It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer . It is n't clear if she did , and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known . It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs . I do n't see how that can be objective . Bauer I 'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al. , but I 've been somewhat overloaded at work . Personally , I think the article is better now than when I first saw it , thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that does n't seem like a lynch mob . Y'all are doing a good job , and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted .

       " 635: \"`` Philosopher RFC philosopher ( from Wiktionary ) : A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy . I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a `` '' philosopher '' '' ( without qualifiers ) in the lead . This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy , only that it is his career . ( Note : Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present . The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that `` '' philosopher '' '' is accurate and widely accepted , then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place . ) Definitions Obviously , each source is going to use slightly different phrasing . Some will call him explicitly a `` '' philosopher '' '' or has views on `` '' philosophy '' '' , but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent . Using one word `` '' philosopher '' '' in the lead sentence covers all of his political , ethical , and theistic specializations in one word , which we then elaborate on later in the article . `` `` philosophical conversation '' '' , `` '' philosophy show '' '' - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series `` '' libertarian '' '' , `` '' libertarian thinker '' '' - `` '' Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...

'' '' `` '' voluntaryist '' '' - `` '' Voluntaryism ( or sometimes voluntarism ) , is a libertarian philosophy ... '' '' `` '' athiest '' '' - `` '' Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches . '' '' `` `` ethics- `` '' Ethics , sometimes known as philosophical ethics , ethical theory , moral theory , and moral philosophy , is a branch of philosophy '' '' `` '' Secular ethics- `` '' Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy ... '' '' Primary source As Stefan Molyneux is a living person , we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him ( obviously , we do n't want to host any sort of `` '' fringe '' '' claims ) . If we are to dispute what he says about himself , though , then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this , or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place . I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct . He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media , which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the `` '' old-school '' '' philosophers we 're used to . Freedomain Radio `` '' About '' '' page - `` '' my Master 's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies `` '' , `` '' I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens .

You posted : `` '' I just read the article , and to be quite honest , feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia 's guidelines ... it is reliably sourced ... Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied ... It now has 11 independent sources . And to refute the argument posed by Wayne , it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised '' '' . Please consider the concerns this post raises . Simple matters like references , notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user , and bread-and-butter for any admin . In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. I do n't have a word for it . `` `` Unreal '' '' is close . The `` '' eleven independent sources '' '' that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time , were : Three references from 2004 [ coates , robinson , shaw ] , certainly before the topic even existed ( ! ) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event ( ! ) Two references from 1st half 2005 [ davies , white ] , almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic 's notability . The promoter 's personal page on his local town website , almost certainly self-published [ official village website ] . A 2008 casual interview in a non-notable and possibly non-reliable university magazine ( apparently ) of the promoter 's travels to see experts in a different sport , with tangential tiny ( < 1 sentence ) mention that he 'd discussed his new sport with them too . [ the Lau Philip `` '' LA '' '' interview ] . 3 entries marked `` '' Reference and support of , Written Reference '' '' [ chris , cook , rhee ] , obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support , that was never published anyway and is n't cited so you ca n't have read it ( not that it was even possibly valid evidence ) . A short writeup of a `` '' local information '' '' kind , on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school , in its local paper . In brief of the 11 : 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less `` '' sourced '' '' material on it or `` '' substantial '' '' coverage ( they had precisely zero coverage ) ; 3 were claims of personal `` '' I think is a great guy '' '' letters of support , evidently solicited and/or written on request , with zero evidence of verifiable existence , and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent ; 1 was self-written 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source ( pretty much `` '' I discussed the topic with them '' '' in a college magazine interview ) 1 is local press coverage of his courses that 's not even `` '' news for a day '' '' or evidence of anything beyond `` '' a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall '' '' . Your assessment of these , at AFD , was : It is reliably sourced { | style= '' '' border : # c0c0c0 solid 1px '' '' width= '' '' 90 % '' '' | There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place ( ! ) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts . Probably via self-promotional input . There is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest . | } That the cited pages are evidence of notability { | style= '' '' border : # c0c0c0 solid 1px '' '' width= '' '' 90 % '' '' | They do n't mention it , or even date from a time the topic existed , nor are online versions provided !

       " 669: \"`` stradbroke galleon / portuguese hallo Moondyne , I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments . I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts , knowledge and information . The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about , discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland , the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here . There exists , in various libraries , books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain . The fact that a story is not accepted by `` '' mainstream '' '' academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions . What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group ( i.e . Hesperian and his friends ) who are representatives of the `` '' mainstream '' '' view . Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian 's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian 's antagonistic attitude , simple , old fashioned professional jealousy . Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons . For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden , identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia . This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates , which is a pity , but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different . Still it is dissapointing . Happy trails. ``\",\n",

I reject such a stance . I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial . Where many Wikipedia editors `` '' get it wrong '' '' is that they believe Wikipedia 's job is to report the truth . This is wrong . Wikipedia 's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is . Any attempt to do that is original research . Instead of `` '' truth '' '' , Wikipedia aims for `` '' verifiability '' '' . Put a different way , Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion ( not our opinions but those of reliable sources ) . If the truth is clear and uncontroversial , it is easy for us to report that . If the truth is murky and controversial , it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict . Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents `` '' THE TRUTH '' '' and not just one perspective ( or POV ) on the topic at hand . I have been trying to hit this NPOV `` '' sweet spot '' '' but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides . Obviously is , because some users ( Jadger and Wikiferdi ) do n't want to discuss in fact , they want us to agree with their POV , that 's not discussion about the NPOV edits .

Czechoslovakia , being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s , had closer ties with the West than Poland did , and was `` '' betrayed '' '' in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was : The West politically accepted the country 's territorial mutilation , which was not the case with Poland . That said , I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland , the Baltics , Yugoslavia , or even Ukraine ( which had never been independent in the first place ) is a good idea .

       " 763: \"`` I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth ’ s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘ brief flirtation ’ would be better . I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little , otherwise the article might appear weighty . I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth ) ) But bedsides , this brief dalliance with Marxism , in an overall consideration of his political career , pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources . This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article . I tried reflecting it as follows : `` '' His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister , who `` '' considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth '' '' but this was dismissed as `` '' speculative opinion '' '' by Off2riorob above , even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth ’ s biography . Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included ? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth , but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end ( and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment ) . Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle. ``\",\n",

That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago . All of my references are verifiable.There 's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation . I did n't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge . I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue . For instance , I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input , and in fact , asked them to work on the article . I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses , citing references from a lawyers point of view . Those references were deleted by someone , I ca n't remember who and do n't know why . At this point , the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript . The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers . Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for . I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts . I do n't believe that I did any original research . All I did is search the Internet for references for the article . I really did n't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article . I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF , which date back to 2004 . Also , when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst . I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago , but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway . Same as the U.N. covenantca n't really hide that . I did n't add a and b together to prove a point , at least not consciously . Like today , I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone , which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand , who was in the fifth circuit . And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words `` '' pro se '' '' in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se ( No , there was not ) . What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly . I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is `` '' soap boxing '' '' . I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business . I 've been an entrepreneur . I did n't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article . That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article . The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article . Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself . One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation . I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I have n't got it yet . But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state , slave state , border state . Also , there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states . The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too , I think . So did the history of workmen 's comp , which is of course related to unions. ``\",\n",

I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles , but was told it was against WP *rules* ( though I was n't pointed to a link for it ) . Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see , even when they have surnames & are not *of* something ! Mary Boleyn is called *Mary* , not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford* , Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk* , etc , & they 're not royals . As for males , I was told they had to be referred to by their title - ie , *Leicester* - or last name - ie , *Dudley* . I was banging head on keyboard going , but - no one just says *the king* all the time or refers to them as *Plantagenet* or keeps changing their titles - ie , Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England - So how does Kate get to be consistently referred to as *Catherine* throughout the article , without her title appended ?

User : Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia , Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not . He is spending a lot of time working on his cause , pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia . How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia : WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member . So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia , and the great damage done by User : Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda . Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction : Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles , cleaning them of false fabricated information , and giving the facts to the world , and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources . I do n't have much time now , but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period . I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals . I am expecting that this user `` '' Laveol '' '' will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia , simply because he is able to , and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda . Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia , Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports . Damemk , I hope you write something here , at least to show that User_talk : Damemk and User_talk : Ejanev is not the same user . Some insight into my user name Ejanev The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is `` '' Ejanev '' '' . It is composed of the first letter of my name `` '' Emil '' '' and my last name `` '' Janev '' '' . User `` '' Damemk '' '' is a separate user . Probably that user name is comming from `` '' Dame '' '' - a Macedonian First name , and `` '' mk '' '' or the code of `` '' Republic of Macedonia '' '' . It does happen that I am from Canada . I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years . And yes , having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it 's attributes by users as `` '' Laveol '' '' , is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia . I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda , that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles . You can watch the contributions of Special : Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50 % of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes. ``\",\n",

Look at this citation '' '' According to Stillman , Muhammad chose Sa 'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir : `` '' Sa ` d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery . '' '' Furthermore , Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba 's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender . '' '' This author is Norman A Stillman , a Zionist Jew who is very biased . Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article ? And further more , why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used , as if it 's a fact ? There are articles for `` '' Criticisms of Islam '' '' where the Jews and others can write whatever they want . But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles . Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there . You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews , without it disappearing instantly . So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles . Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view , and the jews can write their responses in appropriate `` '' criticisms of Islam '' '' articles . If not , I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history . And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles . Good day . Please read this talk page , specifically all of the places where `` '' treason '' '' or `` '' traitor '' '' is mentioned , and if you still believe that we need to mention treason , provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it . It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs , but it does require that people like yourself participate . We work from academic sources , not personal conjecture . Changes by Devotus and issues with them Dear Devotus , I have still issues with your changes : Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you do n't try you shift the balance - removing a book from `` '' each side '' '' - I do not agree with your removal . Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial , she is not beyond the pale - currently she does n't serve as a reference in the article but if she did , the controversy would be noted . As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section , we would have to remove him from the article too , in which he serves as a reference . This is due to the insistence of User : Bless sins . He will certainly not like such a removal . We can not remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article . While your first version was needlessly verbose ( `` '' it is to be noted that '' '' ) , the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt . The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact , since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences . Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the `` '' siege and demise '' '' , e.g . the claim about attacking M. in the rear . Also , please abide by the one resolved conflict . We fought hard and long about words like `` '' massacre '' '' and `` '' execution '' '' and neither should appear unless unavoidable .

       " 893: \"Well , Arthur , I have printed the paper , and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is , not your correction . It seems that the paper is not incorrect , but rather correct and pointless . You have already identified the worst problem : The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values . However , this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e . So let 's do that . We want a function f satisfying f ( 1 ) =e and f ( n+1 ) =exp ( f ( n ) ) , defined as widely as possible . We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems : f ( 0 ) =1 and f ( -1 ) =0 . To extend f to all positive real numbers , it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1 , such as [ 0,1 ) . And we want f to be continuously differentiable . ( The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on ( 0,1 ) , or equivalently on ( -1,0 ) . This is obviously whacky , but we need n't worry about this because a=e . ) Next , for no obvious ( or explained ) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [ 0,1 ] . From the functional equation f ( x ) = ln f ( x+1 ) we get f ' ( x ) = f ' ( x+1 ) /f ( x+1 ) . Hence f ' ( -1 ) =f ' ( 0 ) /f ( 0 ) =f ' ( 0 ) , so f ' must be constant on [ 0,1 ] ! Not too surprisingly , the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way : f ( x ) = exp [ x ] ( exp ( x- [ x ] ) ) . Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0 .\",\n",

For exampleand this is ... yep , maybe you guessed it ... question 2 : Why is it supposedly `` '' okay '' '' ( according to you ) for someone with a name ... like , say ... escape orbit ... to dish out a personal attack , but not for me to give him one back because I 'm just a lowly IP-editor ? Specifically , why is it supposedly `` '' okay '' '' for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of `` '' ebaY '' '' logo to go next to the current one , `` '' ebay , '' '' in the lead , is `` '' because I wanted it in there , '' '' even though that is a total lie ; but it 's supposedly `` '' not okay '' '' for me to call that kind of slander stupid ? 3 . Here 's another one : Why is it supposedly `` '' okay '' '' for him and `` '' smiley girl '' '' there to falsely accuse my edits of being `` '' vandalism '' '' just because they differed from what these guys preferred , but then when I say their reversions are vandalism , I get in trouble for it as if it were a `` '' personal attack '' '' just because I 'm an IP-only editor ? 4 .

Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive ( partial ) `` '' consensus '' '' wants it to say , AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees , you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway , but when I , an IP-only editor who 's against your exclusive `` '' consensus , '' '' do the same thing , it 's `` '' edit-warring '' '' even though it was the same thing as what smiley 's doing ( remember the `` '' being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense '' '' rule ) ? 75.162.211.81 ''\",\n",

She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors . Furthermore , all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question : that is , since Lenin 's Communist regime was good ( major premise ) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime ( minor premise ) , suppressing the rebellion was justified .
